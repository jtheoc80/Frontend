- **Kubernetes Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy-k8s.sh`): Automated Kubernetes deployment

All scripts include:
- Prerequisites validation
- Error handling and logging
- Output formatting with deployment URLs
- Post-deployment verification steps

### âœ… 6. Environment Configuration
- **Environment Templates**:
  - `.env.example`: Development configuration template
  - `.env.production`: Production configuration template
- **Environment Variables**:
  - API endpoints configuration
  - Blockchain RPC settings
  - Monitoring and analytics integration

### âœ… 7. Production Monitoring & Logging
- **Logger Utility** (`src/utils/logger.ts`):
  - Production-ready logging with multiple levels
  - External service integration (Sentry, custom endpoints)
  - Performance monitoring
  - User action tracking
  - Error tracking with context

- **Error Boundary** (`src/components/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.tsx`):
  - React error boundary for graceful error handling
  - Development error details
  - Production error reporting
  - User-friendly error UI

- **Health Check Component** (`src/components/HealthCheck/HealthCheck.tsx`):
  - Application health monitoring

  - Blockchain connectivity validation
  - Localization system checks

### âœ… 8. Security & Best Practices
- **Container Security**:
  - Multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface
  - Non-root user execution in containers
  - Security vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
  - Regular base image updates

- **Network Security**:
  - HTTPS-only communication
  - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - CORS configuration
  - Private network isolation in cloud deployments

- **Secrets Management**:
  - Environment variable-based configuration
  - No secrets in container images or version control
  - Cloud provider secret management integration

### âœ… 9. Documentation
- **Comprehensive Cloud Deployment Guide** (`CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md`):
  - Platform-specific deployment instructions
  - Cost estimation for different cloud providers
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Maintenance procedures
  - Security best practices

- **Updated README.md**:
  - Cloud features overview
  - Quick deployment commands
  - Infrastructure highlights

### âœ… 10. Configuration Management
- **Updated .gitignore**:
  - Proper exclusion of build artifacts
  - Environment file management
  - Terraform state files
  - IDE and OS-specific files

## Testing & Validation

### âœ… Completed Tests
- âœ… Local build process verification
- âœ… Docker container building and running
- âœ… Health check endpoint functionality
- âœ… Application serving via Nginx
- âœ… Multi-stage Docker build optimization

### ðŸ”„ Pending Tests (Require Cloud Access)
- Cloud provider deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- CI/CD pipeline execution
- Terraform infrastructure provisioning

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- **Load Distribution**: Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple instances
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sized containers with resource limits

### Reliability
- **Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring and recovery
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Rolling updates with readiness probes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user feedback

### Observability
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with external service integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics and tracking
- **Health Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure health checks

### Security
- **Container Security**: Vulnerability scanning and secure base images
- **Network Security**: Proper security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration

## Cost Optimization

### Development Environment
- Local Docker development reduces cloud costs
- Resource-optimized containers
- Development profiles for minimal resource usage

### Production Environment
